Studies have shown that a person's income tends to increase with his education level. Here, let's build a model that takes into 
account a person's education level & education years in addition to other variables. Using a logistic regression, let's examine if
it's possible to build a good model to predict income_bracket. More importantly, let's also examine if it's possible to make use
of the confusion matrix and ROC curve to select ideal probability thresholds in order to improve the model's accuracy.

Kindly follow the steps below:
1) Download data from Google Bigquery(ml_datasets > census_adult_income) to local file
Kindly google the steps if unsure
2) Upload dataset & ipynb file to Jupyter notebook
3) Run code & observe the results
Feel free to improve on the model if desired:)
